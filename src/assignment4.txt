*** Assignment 4, Pong ***

We're going to do a version of the Pong computer game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong

NOTE: If any problems with graphics. Go to Canvas > course page > Resurser >
    Java, JavaFX och IntelliJ. See section Koppla ihop JavaFX och IntelliJ.

Requirements
-----------
Game controls are
- Left paddle Q (up), A (down)
- Right paddle  Up arrow (up), Down arrow (down)
- Players will get one point if other misses
- Ball will increase speed with a 5% at each hit.
- If ball disappears from screen, a new ball, with a random speed and random (sensible) direction
  shows up at center of screen (forever ... or until menu File > Stop or Exit)
- No redundant code!

To run the program, run the PongGUI file (will probably not work right now ...).

Directory layout
----------------
The application is divided over a few directories

    - asserts, will hold all images and sounds used.
    - src/pong
        - event/: Classes to handle events sent from model to GUI.
        - model/: The object model classes (the game data and logic)
        - view/: The visible parts (the view of the model) of the program, sound
          and the event handling from GUI to model
        - view/theme: Theme specific classes for GUI

The Object model
------------
- The model has no look, it's just data and logic.
- The overall game is represented by the Pong class.
- Pong class handles the game logic (possibly asking others to help)
- Pong class uses two Paddle objects and a Ball object.

The GUI
--------
This is a graphical event driven JavaFX program. All graphics and event
handling code is in PongGUI and PongMenu files.
- The GUI has no game logic what so ever, it's just the look and the events
  (administration)

Program is "themeable". User may choose different themes for "the look"".
Currently there are two implemented themes, "Cool" and "Duckie"

Inspect class Assets for mappings of objects and images, etc.

Workflow
--------
Some classes are finished, see comments in code (= "Nothing to do here").
This is a suggested workflow ...

1. The over all goal is for now is to display the ball and the paddles in the GUI

a. Decide which data (instance variables) and methods needed in Ball and Paddle.
   This is a trial and error process to get some kind of start. Implement
   (preliminary) classes. If duplicate data use abstract base classes.

   TIP: Use upper left corner as position. Will simplify.
   NOTE: y-axis is pointing down!
   TIP: Use dx, dy for speed. When dx = dy = 0 object is idle.
   NOTE: Anything you intend to draw on screen must implement interface IPositionable

b. If needed, create some test for the classes in test/pong directory. Or
   do it later when needed. //TODO

c. Now concentrate on class Pong. Pong should have references to a Ball object
   and two paddle objects (and more). Add a constructor that takes the objects as
   parameters.

d. In method newGame in PongGUI, try to build the OO-model and assign it to the instance
   variable pong declared at start of class. Use constructors to initialize and connect objects.

e. Try to run until the ball and paddles shows up

2. Next goal is to get the ball to move. The moving of objects is done in method update()
   in Pong class (the "game loop")". In the method tell the ball to move!

a.  Add checks, in update(), to create a new ball if the actual escapes. Also
    when ball escapes give some player a point.

3.  Add classes for floor and ceiling. These objects will make the ball bounce
    when colliding. Create floor and ceiling objects in newGame and
    extend Pongs constructor to take them as parameters.

4.  Add collision detection between ceiling, floor and ball. Make ball bounce.

5.  Make paddles move and add collision detection for ball and paddles. No redundancy
    for collision detection, should be done in one place and one place only.

6.  Add event handling from model to GUI, using Event and EventService. If a collision
    occurs in model send an event to GUI to inform GUI to play a sound.

7. (Optional) Add some twist(s) to the game!

8. (Optional) Add a computer player (AI).
